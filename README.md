# Hotel Data Analysis-Python 
This is the Python Project that deals with the Hotel data which contains the detailed information about the Customers like gender, total bill, tip, day and time, smoker or not,etc.
The data contains details of 244 Customers.

Tools: Excel and Jupyter Notebook

In Jupyter Notebook, using different libraries of Python like numpy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib; I cleaned and analysed the data.
Different functions and libraries used in this project:
1. pd.read_csv()
2. tail()
3. head ()
4. info()
5. unique()
6. nunique()
7. sns.distplot()
8. sns.jointplot()
9. sns.pairplot()
10. sns.kdeplot()
11. sns.countplot()
12. sns.barplot()
13. sns.violinplot().
14. sns.swarmplot()
15. sns.heatmap()
Using the above functions and libraries, I analysed the data. Various different visualization graphs or plots were used to display and help in better understanding of the data. The customer behaviour was analysed using the data from the 'tips' file. The customer is smoker or not and whether male or female was also determined. The tip given by the customer was also analysed to know the customer behavior.
